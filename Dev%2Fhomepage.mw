* Gray scale freedom of press logo. As per https://stackoverflow.com/questions/609273/convert-an-image-to-grayscale-in-html-css ?
** The one small red square actually looks good.
* lower size of duckduck go browser image (it currently is out of proportion, way bigger than all other images)
** Both the tbb screenshot section and the "impossible to leak" are [large text | large image] image sections that highlight the biggest reasons to use whonix. 
** I realized "uses tbb" isn't a special feature, and I combined the two into "All activity takes place inside a virtual machine, all internet traffic is routed through Tor". Will need better text and image
* The "Advanced Security Features" section could be similar to the "Fully Featured" section. Also using medium images.
** At this point we'd be making "one big list of features" that our inspiration websites don't do. (One long list is boring and everything is treated as one thing in a long list. 
** The advanced security features tend to be more nerd stuff directed at an audience that doesn't need an image if isn't required, and easily ignored (but appreciated) by the nontechnical
