Whonix is a free desktop operating system (OS) that is specifically designed for advanced security and privacy. Based on Tor, Debian GNU/Linux and the principle of security by isolation, it realistically addresses common attack vectors while maintaining usability. Online anonymity is made possible via fail-safe, automatic, and desktop-wide use of the Tor network, meaning all connections are forced through Tor or blocked. The Tor network helps to protect from traffic analysis by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by global volunteers. Without advanced, end-to-end, netflow correlation attacks, anybody watching your Internet connection cannot easily determine the sites you visit, and those sites cannot learn your physical location. <ref>Current practical, low-latency, anonymity designs like Tor fail when the attacker can see both ends of the communication channel (traffic going into and out of the Tor network). [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough If you can see both flows], simple statistics based on data volume and timing can determine whether they match up.</ref>
