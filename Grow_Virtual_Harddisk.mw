'''1.''' Back-up your data.

Either move your important files via [[KVM#Shared_Folders|shared folders]] or make a full clone of your VM in each snapshot state in case something goes wrong.

'''2.''' On the host: Delete all existing snapshots.

'''3.''' On the host: Increase the disk size.

<code>1G</code> below needs to be replaced with the amount of memory you would like to add in gigabytes.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qemu-img resize vmdisk.img +1G
}}

'''4.''' Boot up and check if it is still working. 

'''5.''' Install GParted in {{workstation_product_name}} and resize the filesystem to claim the newly added space.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get install gparted
}}
}}
== VirtualBox ==
In case more disk space is required for your virtual hard disk, the good news is that you are still a [[VirtualBox]] user. {{project name}} is nothing special; it is just another VM image. Any suggestions you find for VirtualBox will similarly work for {{project_name}}.

This process is moderately difficult because there is no easy upstream solution (such as a GUI). Further, you have a VMDK disk instead of a VDI disk. <ref>VMDK is the standard for <code>ova</code> images (exported virtual appliances).</ref> There is also no better (free, open source) virtualizer with this feature. However, most users can successfully complete this process and it is easier if {{project name}} is built from source. <ref>Search the file whonix_createvm for *VMNAME="{{workstation_product_name_short}}"* and *VMSIZE="50G"*. Increase *VMSIZE="50G"* for example to *VMSIZE="100G"*.</ref> In case you are using the download version, it is a bit more difficult.

Unfortunately, at the time of writing <code>vboxmanage modifyhd <uuid|filename> --resize <size in mb></code> does not support VMDK images yet. The situation may have subsequently changed.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' On the host: Make a clone of all states of your existing virtual machine in case something goes wrong.

'''2.''' On the host: Delete all existing snapshots.

'''3.''' On the host: Find the folder of your virtual hdd.

{{CodeSelect|code=
vboxmange list hdds
}}

[[Category:Documentation]]
'''4.''' On the host: Switch to that folder.

'''5.''' On the host: Convert from VMDK to VDI.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage clonehd "{{workstation_product_name_short}}-disk1.vmdk" --format vdi "{{workstation_product_name_short}}-disk1.vdi"
}}

'''6.''' Check the syntax.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyhd
}}

'''7.''' On the host: Grow the disk.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyhd "{{workstation_product_name_short}}-disk1.vdi" --resize 100000
}}

'''8.''' On the host: <code>VirtualBox VM settings</code> &rarr; <code>mass storage</code>.

Remove the old <code>.vmdk</code>, add the new <code>.vdi</code>.

'''9.''' Boot up and check if it is still working.

'''10.''' Up to this point only the physical size was increased, but the filesystem has not been changed. Shut down again.

'''11.''' Inside VM: You have to boot from a boot cd (Ubuntu Precise *DVD* did work) and use a tool like gparted to grow the filesystem. 

Start a terminal.

{{CodeSelect|code=
lxsudo gparted
}}

'''12.''' Inside VM: Increase the filesystem. Apply and shut down.

The procedure is complete.
