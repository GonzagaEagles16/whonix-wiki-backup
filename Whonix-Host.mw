Whonix-Host is based on:

* Debian
* [[Kicksecure]]
* XFCE
* KVM

Whonix-Host, comes with the hypervisor KVM and both Whonix VMs, Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation pre-installed by default.

Whonix ISO Live is a Live ISO which comes with a calamares based installer. The user can use Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation in Live Mode from ISO.

The user has also the option to install Whonix-Host on an internal hard drive or external drive such as a USB drive.

Once installed, what we call Whonix-Host Installed, the user can again choose to boot into persistent mode or into live mode in grub boot menu thanks to [[grub-live]].

= Advantages =
* Whonix-Host ISO will be available as a Live ISO. I.e. can boot Whonix-Host from Live DVD or Live USB.
* Whonix-Host installed will have a boot menu option to boot into persistent mode or live mode.
* No clearnet traffic by default. ([https://forums.whonix.org/t/should-whonix-host-be-fully-torified-by-default/7404/16 details])

= Differences with Qubes-Whonix =
* Not having some of [https://forums.whonix.org/t/qubes-whonix-security-disadvantages-help-wanted/8581 Qubes-Whonix security disadvantages].
* Better hardware support. (Same as Debian.)
* Does not involve Fedora on dom0 host.
* No, no having any clearnet traffic by default in Qubes is not easily possible, see:
** [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1814 sys-net phones home to fedoraproject.org for captive portal detection] (Ticket was closed but the issue was not fixed.)
