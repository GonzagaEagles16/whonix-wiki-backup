= Introduction =
{{project_name}} is available for:

* [[Qubes]]
* [[KVM]]
* [[VirtualBox]]

In an ideal world, {{project name}} would support all Virtualization Platforms. Theoretically it could be done using [http://libvirt.org/ libvirt]. Practically libvirt is out of question. [https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvirt-users/2012-August/msg00150.html libvirt-users Does libvirt abstract each and any vm specific command?] Libvirt does not (yet) abstract some commands {{project name}} depends on.

= Other Virtualization Platforms =
== Introduction ==
In theory, {{project name}} could run inside any virtualizer, because its build scripts are very modular and extensible. In reality, {{project name}} has no man power to test other virtualizers. As soon as contributors join the project and maintain support for other virtualizers, support for them can most likely be easily added.

== Support Plan ==
{{project_name}} would need a [[Contribute#Maintainer|maintainer]] to support the other virtualization platform.

Important:

* Someone who runs those [[Test]], [[LeakTests]] and tests from [[Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection]].
* Someone who otherwise looks around if everything is sane.

Ideal:

* Someone who creates, signs, uploads .ova images for the other virtualization platform (such as VMware, KVM, etc.).

== Partially Finished Attempts ==
* [[QEMU]] (deprecated)
* [[VMware]] (proof of concept, no maintainer)

= VirtualBox =
== Is VirtualBox an Insecure Choice? ==

<u>Update</u>:

Although [[VirtualBox]] is [[Dev/Virtualization Platform|not an ideal choice]], fortunately other platforms are [[Download|supported]]:

* [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]].
* [[KVM|{{project_name}} for KVM / Virt-Manager]]. 

For greater security, users with suitable hardware and sufficient skill are recommended to  [[Virtualization_Platform_Security#Type_1_vs_Type_2_Hypervisors|prefer {{q_project_name}}]] (a bare-metal hypervisor) over Type 2 hypervisors like VirtualBox.

The primary reason {{project name}} supports VirtualBox is because it is a familiar, cross-platform virtualizer which can attract more users to open source (free/Libre) software, Tor and Linux in general. By remaining highly accessible, Whonix: 

* Increases the scope of potential growth in the user base.
* Attracts greater attention as a suitable anonymity-focused operation system.
* Increases the likelihood of additional human resources and monetary contributions.
* Allows novice users to easily test {{project name}} and learn more about security and anonymity practices.
* Improves the relative security and anonymity of Tor / Tor Browser users by offering a virtualized solution.

=== {{project name}} in VirtualBox vs Tor / Tor Browser / Torified Applications on the Host ===

It is recognized that VirtualBox is not an ideal choice; see [[Dev/Virtualization Platform]]. However, there are different goals to bear in mind - {{project name}} is primarily focused on protecting a user's IP address / location.

A common refrain of critics is that VirtualBox is "too weak". This is a theoretical concern and does not have any practical implications at present, since {{project name}} in VirtualBox is actually more secure than running Tor, Tor Browser or torified applications on the host in many cases; see [[Security in Real World|{{project_name}} Security in the Real World]]. 

It must be remembered that there are no alternatives for a large segment of the population who do not have sufficiently powerful hardware to run [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]], or who are technically incapable of running [[KVM]]. In this case, it is safer for them to run {{project name}} in VirtualBox, rather than continuing to utilize Tor on the host. For example, {{project name}} helps to protect against future [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/firefox-security-bug-proxy-bypass-current-tbbs proxy bypass bugs] or software which [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea does not honor proxy settings].

The strength of {{project name}} and virtualization in general is adherence to the security by isolation principle. VirtualBox critics need to objectively consider how many exploits currently exist for VirtualBox and the track record of exploits. Admittedly, virtual machine exploits may become far more problematic in the future, but at present {{project name}} is considered to provide more security out of the box running in VirtualBox, than not.
 
=== Platforms with Improved Security ===

Anybody seriously considering {{project name}} for improved security should refer to the [[Documentation]], particularly the Security Guide and Advanced Security Guide entries, as well as [[Download|supported platforms]] other than VirtualBox. {{project name}} is a poster child for the [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IsolatingProxy Isolating Proxy Concept] and [http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2008/09/three-approaches-to-computer-security.html Security by Isolation].

Many users still default to running Tor on their Windows or Linux host. {{project name}} is immediately available to this cohort to substantially improve their real world security. Indeed, {{project name}} is the only up-to-date OS designed to be run inside a VM and paired with Tor, which is actively maintained and developed. Other similar projects like [http://www.janusvm.com/tor_vm/ JanusVM] are seriously outdated and no longer actively maintained. <ref>In response to whether JanusVM was safe to use, Roger Dingledine of The Tor Project [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-December/022446.html stated in 2011]: "No, not safe. Probably has been unsafe to use for years."</ref>

{{project_name}} cannot serve all target audiences. Users seeking a higher security solution will prefer [[Download|other supported platforms]], like [[{{q project name short}}|{{q project name}}]]. "Hardcore" users may prefer to build their own custom hardened solutions, while still profiting from {{project name}} research and source code. Hardened solutions like the [[Hardened Gentoo TG|Hardened Gentoo {{gateway_product_name}}]] are more difficult to use and therefore cannot be set as the default installation for {{project_name}}.

== VirtualBox missing features ==
Signatures (not important because we offer OpenPGP / gpg signatures):

* https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=94327#p455421


The following is non-ideal for [[Comparison_with_Others#Verifiable_Builds|verifiable builds]], because we have to convert to vdi first:

* [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=58460 export VM using VDI instead of VMDK?]: seems not possible.
* [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=58461 Mount VMDK on Debian jessie?]: seems not possible.

The following is non-ideal, because we can not warn when host operating systems are being used we don't think are the right tool for hosting {{project name}} VMs:

* [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=58498 Can a guest find out its host operating system?]: seems not possible.

* VirtualBox uses VMDK version 3. This is non-ideal, because working with these images is difficult.
** Converting these images is difficult.
*** <s>qemu-img version 1.6.1 ({{Code|qemu-img convert "vmdk_file" -O RAW "vdi_file"}}) fails with: {{Code2|qemu-img: 'image' uses a vmdk feature which is not supported by this qemu version: VMDK version 3}}, which is a [https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1253465 known issue in qemu].</s> As per [https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1253465 this], QEMU version equal or bigger than {{Code2|2.8}} should be capable to work with VMDK version 3 disks. TODO: try
*** Therefore it is required to convert them with VBoxManage to .vdi first. ({{Code|VBoxManage clonehd --format VDI "vmdk_file" "vdi_file"}})
** <s>Therefore the Free guestmount doesn't support mounting VMDK version 3 as well (because it internally uses qemu-img).</s> (Still true?)
** <s>It requires proprietary software to mount them, such as the proprietary nbdkit plugin [https://github.com/libguestfs/nbdkit/blob/master/plugins/vddk/README.VDDK vddk]. We're not aware of a Free Software alternative yet.</s> (Still true?)

When importing VMs these become VDI images nowadays with recent VirtualBox versions.

== VirtualBox no longer in Debian main ==
* http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=709899
* http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00057.html
* "Virtualbox ships a BIOS that requires Watcom to compile from real sources,precompiled copy they ship as well is free but is not the preferred form for modification." http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00106.html
* https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/12011
* https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/029978.html

* This is unrelated to <code>VirtualBox Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack</code>, which is proprietary, and which was never in Debian.

== Arguments for keeping VirtualBox Support ==
* [[KVM]] is not available to Windows users.
* Simplicity, as in: [[VirtualBox]] has a VM import GUI feature.
* Available to users not owning computer providing hardware virtualization. ([[KVM]] requires that. [[QEMU]] may or may not but is [[unsupported]].)
* Due to Windows users and simplicity it leads to greater popularity, which in theory attracts more users, developers, auditors, [[payments]], etc and is therefore good for the overall health of the project.
* Some Windows/[[VirtualBox]] users experimenting with their first Linux ({{project_name}}) will one day become users who mainly use Linux as their host operating system.
* We have a [[Windows Quick Start|{{project_name}} Windows Installer]] which installs VirtualBox {{project_name}} VirtualBox VMs because of [[Dev/Whonix-Windows-Installer#Rationale|these reasons]].
