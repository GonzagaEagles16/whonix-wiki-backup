SSH is a core tool in a sysadmin's arsenal. It is mainly used to remotely control a machine.

Use stronger ssh keys.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
}}

Prefer SSH servers available through a [[Onion Services|Tor Onion Service]] for stronger encryption and authentication. Consider using [[Onion_Services#Onion_Service_Authentication|Onions Services Authentication]]. Tor also provides NAT hole-punching so you don't need to register with a DNS service nor open up your LAN to outside access. If the server is known to the public (non-hidden) one could use single Tor hops for the server, see [[Non Anonymous Onion Encryption and NAT Traversal]].

Any references to SSH breaks in the Snowden archives applied to some outdated ciphers.

<s>This has since been addressed by hardened OpenSSH settings (which are included in {{project_name}}) and upstream disabling vulnerable algorithms.<ref>https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/112802/why-openssh-deprecated-dsa-keys</ref><ref>https://stribika.github.io/2015/01/04/secure-secure-shell.html</ref></s>

[https://packages.debian.org/jessie/mosh mosh] might be useful, however since it requires UDP, using it over Tor is non-trivial, see [[ Tunnel UDP over Tor]].

Beware of keyboard keystroke and computer mouse based deanonymization as explained under [[Surfing Posting Blogging]].

Can be combined with [[Two-factor authentication 2FA]] (undocumented).

Configuration SSH servers to listen on non-default ports reduces noise (automated hacking attempts) as well might increase security from lesser skilled attackers.
