Anti Evil Maid (AEM) notes.

Adversary capabilities:

* physical access
* remove disk
* re-fash BIOS
* exfiltrate TPM

----

Anti Evil Maid (AEM) alternatives:

* BIOS password
** attack requires removal of disk
** there might be a BIOS master password
* boot partition on USB
** attack on BIOS required
** or USB persistent modifications
* disk hasher &rarr; attack on BIOS required

----

Anti Evil Maid security issues:

* download binary file SINIT without verification and hope the processor will correctly verify it
* rely on closed source TPM

----

Anti Evil Maid (AEM)

* authenticates machine to the user (not user to machine)
* change in BIOS &rarr; reseal required
* another complicated password?
* picture support was deprecated?
* one time password support OTP TOTP ("google authenticator) ([[Two-factor authentication 2FA|2FA]])
* measurement of Xen, kernel, and initrd versions
* only compatible with legacy boot
* not compatible with UEFI
* not compatible with USB 3.0
* hide USB from dom0 (more secure but also more fragile) (BadUSB attack) vs not-hide (able to use USB AEM)
* AEM on USB encourages to boot from USB &rarr; makes it easier for an evil maid (no need to change settings in BIOS)
* a reason for AEM on USB &rarr; as a keyfile (second factor) &rarr; better yubikey
