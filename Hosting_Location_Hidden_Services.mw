= Introduction =

This page discusses and compares the different kinds of hosting options utilizing location/IP hidden servers. It is possible to host anonymous services such as web sites either:
* at home using Tor [[Onion Services]];
* at servers you physically own; or
* using (free) services provided by third parties, such as free <code>.onion</code> web space, VPS servers, web space and so on.

The five most common methods of running location hidden servers includes: Tor Onion Services, using a VPN provider with remote port forwarding, local host tunneling such as [https://pagekite.net/ PageKite] (which makes your local host a server), <code>.onion</code> webspace, and via anonymous third party hosts. 

An overview of these methods and a comparison table is provided below. Readers who are unsure of which method to use are recommended to review Tor [[Onion Services]], since they are the easiest to configure and provide the strongest anonymity.

= Anonymous Hosting Overview =

== Tor Onion Services ==

Onion Services provide a number of benefits. First, they are censor resistant which means that nobody can take the <code>.onion</code> domain offline unless they compromise the host and / or perform a successful flood attack. <ref>See [https://github.com/Attacks-on-Tor/Attacks-on-Tor Thirteen years of Tor Attacks] for a description of flood and other attacks against Tor.</ref> In addition, Onion Services are accessible over tor2web over http, although this is not as censor-resistant as the <code>.onion</code> domain itself.

Onion Services are also free and do not require any registration to run (no sign up is required). Further, they do not require any additional software other than the server software that will be run anonymously. Onion Services are flexible insofar as they can easily be run at home, on any server physically owned, or on (anonymous) third party hosts.

== VPN with Remote Port Forwarding ==

The level of censorship resistance afforded by VPNs depends on the specific provider used. While services will be reachable by a wider audience (clients) because Tor is not required, there are probably no free VPN services providing [http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/16627/does-portforwarding-present-a-risk-to-anonymity Remote Port Forwarding].

Unlike Onion Services, registration/sign up is very likely required which is a challenge to maintaining anonymity. On the upside, this configuration can be run at home, on any server physically owned, or on (anonymous) third party hosts.

== PageKite ==

[https://pagekite.net/ PageKite] is another alternative service which has been tested inside {{workstation_product_name}}, and is functional out of the box (although less tested by {{project name}} developers).

PageKite is a subscription-based service, but is free for Free Software authors; application for a free account is required. Further, it is necessary to comply with the [https://pagekite.net/humans.txt PageKite terms of service], register, and provide an (anonymous) [[E-Mail]] address.

Besides this entry, there is no documentation for pairing PageKite with {{project_name}}. However, it is relatively simple to use and their service is well documented; see [https://pagekite.net/wiki/Howto/PageKiteOverTor/ Running PageKite over Tor] and the footnotes. <ref>
* Instead of localhost it is possible to use the {{gateway_product_name}} IP <code>10.152.152.10</code> and a custom port such as 9159, that is replace "''--torify=localhost:9050''" with "''--torify=10.152.152.10:9159''".
* Alternatively, the "''--torify''" switch can be dropped and the default PageKite GNU/Linux tutorial instructions followed, since ''misc traffic'' in {{workstation_product_name}} is automatically routed through Tor's TransPort.
* See [[Stream Isolation]] for an explanation of ''misc traffic'', custom Socks Ports, and Tor's TransPort in {{project_name}}.</ref>

== Anonymous Third Party Hosts ==

There are many so-called offshore or anonymous hosting companies. Most of these hosting companies do not really offer anonymity because they usually require valid registration data (real name etc.), forbid registration over Tor and/or do not offer anonymous payment methods.

The ones listed in the following list are Tor user-friendly, accept anonymous registration and can be paid anonymously with Bitcoin or prepaid cards. ([https://forums.whonix.org/t/abolishing-third-party-hosting-services-in-wiki List deprecated.]) Also note:

* There are some free <code>.onion</code> web hosting services, as well as paid ones.
* Anonymous VPS servers also exist, but none are free; this necessitates use of [[Money|anonymous money]].

= Conclusion =

Each way to run location hidden servers has its own advantages and disadvantages.

With Tor Onion Services, you don't have to learn and obtain anonymous money, which is difficult on its own. You have to trust no one, but your own skills setting up a server. No one can censor the server, there is no signup, no terms of service. Disadvantage is, if someone compromises your onion service either by an successful attack against Tor onion services are by an successful attack against your server software and breaking out of {{project_name}}, it is game over. It is only accessible over .onion (visitors need Tor) and tor2web does not get indexed by search engines. Tor Onion Services are only online as long as your server is online.

A free (or paid) .onion web space host can steal your domain any time and take it over. You don't have to worry about server security and successful attacks against the Tor onion services won't lead to your location or IP address.

Anonymous Third Party Hosts for VPS hosting involve anonymous money, which is difficult on its own. They can provide clearnet domains and/or you can use them to host Tor onion services. You don't have to worry about server security and successful attacks against Tor onion services won't lead to your location or IP address.
