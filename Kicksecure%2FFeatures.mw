{{kicksecure}} is a hardened operating system designed to be resistant to viruses and malicious code. Based on hardened Debian in accordance with an advanced multi-layer defense model. {{kicksecure}} provides protection from many types of malware in its default configuration with no customizations required. 

'''Multi-layered hardening enhancements provides security in-depth by default.'''
* [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Entropy#haveged haveged / jitterentropy-rng] installed to provide better [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(computing) entropy] for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(computing) cryptographic] tools.
*  [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/TimeSync Insecure] Network Time Protocal ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol NTP]) is replaces with Secure Distributed Web Date ([[Sdwdate|sdwdate]]) to mitigate threats from [[TimeSync#Attacks|time based attacks]].
* Inclusion of package [https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc security-misc] to strengthen areas commonly targeted for attack.<ref>For example; kernel hardening, strong linux user account separation and numerous misc security settings</ref>
* [https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/wikis/home/ Apparmor] is enabled by default. Apparmor protects operating system and applications from external or internal threats, even zero-day attacks, by enforcing good behavior and preventing even unknown application flaws from being exploited.
*  [[SecBrowser|SecBrowser; A Security-hardened Non-anonymouse Browser]] is installed by default. Developed for use with {{kicksecure}}, Secbrowser has numerous enhancements which provides better protection from exploits, thereby reducing the risk of infection from malicious, arbitrary code.
* [https://github.com/Whonix/open-link-confirmation Open Link Confirmation] enabled by default prevents links from being unintentionally opened in supported browsers such as SecBrowser. 
* To mitigate threats from  DNS cache poisoning -- commonly referred to as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing DNS spoofing] -- [https://dnscrypt.info/ dnscrypt] is enable by default.<ref>DNS spoofing results in traffic being diverted to the attacker's computer (or any other computer)</ref>
* [[Hardened Malloc]] is enabled by default; which mitigates threats from memory attacks. Hardened Malloc can be  used with numerous applications to increase security.<ref>This is a security-focused general purpose memory allocator providing the malloc API along with various extensions. It provides substantial hardening against heap corruption vulnerabilities.</ref>
*  [https://firejail.wordpress.com/ Firejail] enabled by default. This easy to use [https://firejail.wordpress.com/documentation-2/basic-usage/#suid SUID] sandbox program reduces the risk of security breaches by restricting the running environment of untrusted applications.

'''{{kicksecure}} provides usability by default. This means {{kicksecure}} can be used as an everyday multipurpose operating system.''' 

* Package [https://github.com/Whonix/shared-folder-help shared folder help] simplifies shared folder set up for virtual machines.<ref>Currently only helps using shared folders with VirtualBox. Other virtualizers -- such as KVM shared folder setup -- might be possible in the future</ref>
* Package [https://github.com/Whonix/usability-misc usabilty-misc] installed by default which improves usability and provides increased flexibility.

'''Popular applications come pre-installed and configured with safe defaults to make them ready for use right out of the box.'''
* TODO

'''Sensitive user data is protected by state-of-the-art cryptographic tools.'''
* Local user data is protected by Linux Unified Key Setup  ([https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/home LUKS]) which uses strong encryption to safe-guard your information.<ref>See when [[Full Disk Encryption]] can -- and can not --protect your data.</ref>
* Communications (email) can be both [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption end-to-end encrypted] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature signed] with [[OpenPGP]].
