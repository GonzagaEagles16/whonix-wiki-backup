Development of [[WP:LUA|Lua]] support for both {{cs1}} and {{cs2}} began at '''Module:Citation'''.  That development was abandoned in 2013 as development of [[Module:Citation/CS1]] began.

Though this module remained unused, it is and has been the root page of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PrefixIndex?prefix=Citation&namespace=828 several module subpages that implement cs1 and cs2].  The content of this module was replaced with an error message return as the result of a [[Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2018_May_13#Module:Citation|2018 TfD]].
